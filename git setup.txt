These steps worked beautifully on my windows 10:
        
        mkdir sample

cd sample

git init

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/sample.git

git pull origin master

nano README.md

git add -A

git commit -m "added"

git push origin master

Thanks a lot.

I just replaced "nano" with "notepad" on my system.
